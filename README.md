# CNN_CIFAR10_study
This repository contains code aimed at exploring the effects of different hyperparameters of a convolutional neural network, trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. The main file containing the assignment is the Jupyter notebook `/project1.ipynb`, however it is [best viewed on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/babsyco/CNN_CIFAR10_study/blob/master/project1.ipynb) as it sometimes has trouble rendering here on GitHub. The initially provided Jupyter Notebook is included in `/provided_files_and_code`.
